### Turtle Blueprints

Turtles are robots of the Computercraft mod for Minecraft.
They can be programmed in the game to move around and place blocks.
This can be easily used to build predefined structures, however typing a building blueprint by hand is difficult.
I made a simple tool with a graphical interface for that, that can also upload the blueprint script to pastebin.

| LAN Food Delivery List v1 | LAN Food Delivery List v2|

| <p align='center'><img src="images/cmd_2021-07-09_17-47-43.png" height=200></p>   Originally the idea came up in 2009, because it took a long time to get everyone's food order at LAN events. In an attempt to solve this, I made a batch script that everyone could open, type their name and order in, and it would be appended to a log file on a local host. | <p align='center'><img src="images/java_2021-07-09_17-48-08.png" height=200></p>    One of the first apps I made in Java was a GUI version of this tool. Instead of the Windows file system, it used sockets to connect to a local host. The tool was made in the BlueJ editor, using the `Stifte und Mäuse` library for Java beginners, for GUI and Networking. |
