Initially I used gifs for animations. 
These version will remain here as backup files.
Gifs are optimized first by reducing size and framerate, reduction of color palette + dithering, 
then run through lossy gif encoder for another 30-50% reduction.

Webp support seems fine on every browser I tried, including my phone.
This offers full range colors, no dithering, and smaller file sizes.
I still follow my gif guidelines of low-framerate small images, but much more relaxed with at least 10 fps and 700 width.
I could run 24 fps while being competitive with gifs, but I like the low framerate effect, 
making it look like you're not just watching 5 videos simultaneously, and giving the effect that it's just a preview.
